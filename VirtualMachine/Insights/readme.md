If a log analytics workspace resource is already available and VMInsights is already configured on that resource, then values can be placed into VMInsights.json file from that resource and that will be the only template that you will need.  Otherwise, deploy in this order:

Log Analytics Workspace
Log Analytics Workspace VM Insights
VM Insights
