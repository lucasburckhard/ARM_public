I've included an example Desired State Configuration file and I will likely be adding more to it later.  Currently this state file will download and install dotnet hosting framework; then it will initialize any disk drives that have been added; finally it will create a shared folder in the F: drive (this will need to be changed if you haven't added any disk drives, change it to the C: drive.)
